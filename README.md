# mern-ecommerce

This is a simple MERN ecommerce web app.

Those are the most interesting features in it:
1. Transactional logic to handle possible concurrent access to limited stock (see[ orders/service.js](https://github.com/IbrahimMohammed47/mern-ecommerce/blob/main/orders/service.js))
2. Stripe integration (Webhook and API)
3. Auth0 integration (Authentication and User management API)

Other than that it was just to practice clean code and some best practices in nodejs and react applications
